### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Robert and I just completed my Bachellor's Degree and I am heading towards my Master's Degree. I just had the idea to create a README.md for myself and am thinking of adding one of the strange stats trackers that many people are using, for now I am just checking how it works.

**A friendly advice**. If you are looking to work with me, instead of looking what my zodiac sign is and how possitively I see myself why don't you spend a bit of time to check my work and my commits to have a clear picture about me? Just saying... if you are not willing to check my code, what are we even doing here.

## A short resume: ##
 - Bachellor's Degree on Software Development
 - Healthy activity on Github since 2013
 - A ton of small certificates from Coursera, Linkedin Learning and other sources
 - Languages: Java, Python, Javascript, C#
 - Databases: Well... a LOT of them, (I am a DB and Server guy. Consider me backend to the bone)
 - Cat person, but I like all animals including dogs. I like Rock/Metal music, and OF COURSE I play games, (pc-games, board games, card games - You name it, I play it)
 - **Just check my code**. There is nothing incredibly useful that you can find by checking my little readme.
