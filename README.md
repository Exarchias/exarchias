### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is ***Robert*** and I just completed my Bachellor's Degree and I am heading towards my Master's Degree. Also, I am working at IKEA, and it feels awesome to work there.

**A small tip**. If you wish to understand how I work, instead of looking what my zodiac sign is and "how possitively I see myself", why don't you spend a bit of time to check my work and my commits to have a clear picture about me? Just saying... if you are not willing to check my code, then, what are we even doing here?

## A short resume: ##
 - Worked at IKEA during my Accelerator Programme. It was fun but now is over. 
 - Bachellor's Degree on Software Development, (with the grade 3.83 on the scale of 5).
 - Healthy activity on Github since 2013
 - A ton of small certificates from Coursera, Linkedin Learning and other sources
 - Languages: Java, Python, Javascript, C#
 - Databases: Well... a LOT of them, (I am a DB and Server guy. Consider me as backend to the bone)
 - Cat person, but I like all animals including dogs. I like Rock/Metal music, and OF COURSE I play games, (pc-games, board games, card games - You name it, I play it)
 - **Just check my code**. There is nothing incredibly useful that you can find just by checking my little readme.
